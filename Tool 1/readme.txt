Created MonoBehaviour Asset: Property.cs 
It was designed to help with the APP 3 I have finished. It makes a easier way to create a character with the properties of Health, Weapon type, coins amount and Fire rate. 

The differences between the default editor and the custom one are:
1. The private number of coins is showed on the editor(it can be use for debug and other monitoring stuff).
2. The input of the properties are limited to legit numbers by using three methods. The Slider can be set up for its maximum and minimum value to control the input. For the textfield, i used code to check if the number is in the range of maximum health and the minimum. For the Weapon type, the Pop up box is used to limit the input to be in the collection of the weapon i would design in the game.
3. The Layout of the editor is customized to make the properties more easy to find.
